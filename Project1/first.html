			<h2>Soccer is Love!</h2>
			<p>I love soccer because it is a beautiful and exciting sport. It is a game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels, and it is a sport that is played all over the world. I have been playing soccer all my life and when I get on the field I forget every other thing. Not only do I love playing but I also love watching the game. The team that I support is Liverpool and I've been supporting them since I was 13 years of age. </p>
			<p>Here's a picture of me practicing alone.
