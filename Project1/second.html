			<h2>Music!</h2>
			<p>The guitar is one of the most popular musical instruments in the world. I learned playing guitar when I was 15. I was actually inspired by the talented singer, song-writer Ed Sheeran. Learning to play the guitar was quite challenging than I thought. I am still learning it and hope to master it one day.</p>
